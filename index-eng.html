				<div class="articles__name">Registration of a foreigner as an individual entrepreneur</div>
				<div class="articles__text">Ukraine is a country that has always interested many foreign citizens, companies, foreign entrepreneurs, banks to introduce their activities, open businesses and invest in Ukrainian projects, which enables the Ukrainian economy to progress every year. Even during the war, Ukraine remains a platform for introducing a successful business, and after the war, I believe that Ukraine will become one of the largest countries in Europe, in which people will want to invest and open their businesses.
               Therefore, I would like to briefly describe the steps of how a foreigner can register himself as an individual entrepreneur, which will enable you to start introducing your business in the territory of Ukraine.
               
               STEP 1.
               First of all, to register a natural person-entrepreneur, a foreigner needs to be legally in the territory of Ukraine: you need to obtain a temporary or permanent residence permit in Ukraine and register your place of residence.
               And also, the foreigner will need to get an identification tax number. (the service is free and the delivery period is 5 working days).
               An important point will be to correctly specify the types of activities according to the classifier and choose exactly those types that you will need in your activity. It is worth remembering that conducting activities that do not correspond to those specified in the registration data of the FOP may entail sanctions.
               
               STEP 2. 
               After you have received all the necessary documents, namely: an identification tax number, a temporary/permanent residence permit, a notarized translation of your passport into Ukrainian, you need to contact the relevant registration service or a notary and submit an application for the registration of a natural person-entrepreneur.
               
               STEP 3. 
               The term of registration usually takes one day after submitting an application for registration of a natural person-entrepreneur.
               After that, you will need to receive an extract that will confirm the registration of an individual entrepreneur.
               !!! If a person who has not reached the age of majority, but has reached the age of 16 and plans to register as an individual entrepreneur, a notarized written consent of parents or guardians is required.

				<div class="articles__text">
               Certificate of registration of a person as a citizen of Ukraine is a document that confirms the fact of registration of a person as a citizen of Ukraine and is submitted by a person to receive documents confirming citizenship of Ukraine.
               For this, a person who wishes to receive a certificate should apply to the Department of Social Security at the place of residence. The most important thing is to correctly prepare and submit a written application with a request to provide this public service.
               
               How to get a certificate of registration of a person as a citizen of Ukraine?
               It is necessary to personally apply to the territorial body of the migration service, but if a person has valid reasons for which he cannot personally receive a certificate, this document is issued to a legal representative (parents, guardians).
               
               Documents required to receive the service:
               ➢	In order to receive the administrative service of issuing a certificate of registration of a person as a citizen of Ukraine, the recipient submits an application in which information about the applicant is indicated: surname, first name, patronymic, place of residence, telephone.
               ➢	2 photos measuring 35 x 45 mm.
               ➢	a payment document (receipt) with a note from the bank, post office, or transaction code for payment of the cost of this service;
               ➢	a passport document or a document that replaces it and certifies the identity of the applicant:
               ➢	a document on the applicant's residence on the territory of Ukraine or on his permanent residence abroad (certificate of registration of the place of residence).
               
               !!! If necessary, a certified translation of the text of the document into Ukrainian is provided.
               The term of service provision – after a decision was made on the acquisition of citizenship by a person, a certificate is officially issued to him within ten days.
