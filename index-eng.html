				<div class="articles__name">Registration of a foreigner as an individual entrepreneur</div>
				<div class="articles__text">Ukraine is a country that has always interested many foreign citizens, companies, foreign entrepreneurs, banks to introduce their activities, open businesses and invest in Ukrainian projects, which enables the Ukrainian economy to progress every year. Even during the war, Ukraine remains a platform for introducing a successful business, and after the war, I believe that Ukraine will become one of the largest countries in Europe, in which people will want to invest and open their businesses.
               Therefore, I would like to briefly describe the steps of how a foreigner can register himself as an individual entrepreneur, which will enable you to start introducing your business in the territory of Ukraine.
               
               STEP 1.
               First of all, to register a natural person-entrepreneur, a foreigner needs to be legally in the territory of Ukraine: you need to obtain a temporary or permanent residence permit in Ukraine and register your place of residence.
               And also, the foreigner will need to get an identification tax number. (the service is free and the delivery period is 5 working days).
               An important point will be to correctly specify the types of activities according to the classifier and choose exactly those types that you will need in your activity. It is worth remembering that conducting activities that do not correspond to those specified in the registration data of the FOP may entail sanctions.
               
               STEP 2. 
               After you have received all the necessary documents, namely: an identification tax number, a temporary/permanent residence permit, a notarized translation of your passport into Ukrainian, you need to contact the relevant registration service or a notary and submit an application for the registration of a natural person-entrepreneur.
               
               STEP 3. 
               The term of registration usually takes one day after submitting an application for registration of a natural person-entrepreneur.
               After that, you will need to receive an extract that will confirm the registration of an individual entrepreneur.
               !!! If a person who has not reached the age of majority, but has reached the age of 16 and plans to register as an individual entrepreneur, a notarized written consent of parents or guardians is required.

               How to get a certificate of registration of a person as a citizen of Ukraine?

               Documents required to receive the service:

Frequently asked questions and response:
1)	In the list of documents submitted to obtain an immigration permit, there is a document of residence abroad. What kind of document can this be?

Submission of a document on the place of residence of a foreign citizen or stateless person abroad is provided by current legislation. The document on the place of residence abroad must contain the exact address of the foreigner's place of residence (for example, a certificate of the housing authority, issued in accordance with the law, bank account, driver's license, etc.).

				<div class="articles__name">Permanent residence permit</div>
				<div class="articles__text">
					The permanent residence permit is a document confirming the right of a foreigner or stateless person to permanent residence in the country. This is usually a document that gives the right to leave and enter the country freely throughout the period of validity of the permanent residence permit.

The permanent residence permit is issued on the basis of an immigration permit, so after a positive decision to obtain an immigration permit, a foreigner can apply for a permanent residence permit.


Advantages of a permanent residence permit:

1.	The right to employment without a relevant employment permit;
2.	Visit the country without limits on the number;
3.	No need to extend the validity of the certificate every year;
4.	A foreigner retains his / her citizenship of the country, but at the same time is a resident of Ukraine.

It is important to understand that a foreigner is issued a copy of the immigration permit, as the original remains with the Migration Service.

List of documents that must be submitted to the migration service to obtain a temporary residence permit:
Original passport.,
Notarized and translated passport of a foreigner., Copy of immigration permit.,
Receipt of payment of state duty.

!!! If a foreigner was not on the territory of Ukraine during the examination of immigration permit documents, he will need to obtain a separate type D visa.

The deadline for consideration of documents is 15 working days !!!

After you have received a temporary residence permit, you need to register your place of residence in Ukraine within 30 days from the date of issue of the Permanent residence permit you received. Sometimes foreigners think that 30 days are deducted from the moment of obtaining a permanent residence permit, but this is not the case, 30 days are deducted from the date of issue, which is indicated on the permanent residence permit itself.

In general, the procedure for obtaining a temporary residence permit does not seem complicated at first glance, but in practice, the situation is completely different, there are many unclear details and the process requires close contact with the State Migration Service.

For more detailed information, we recommend signing up for a free consultation.

					Work permit for foreigners and stateless persons - a document that entitles the employer to temporarily use the work of a foreigner or stateless person, or voluntarily obtained by a resident of Action City to enter into a big contract with a foreigner or stateless person.
According to the legislation of Ukraine, foreigners and stateless persons cannot work without a work permit. In addition, a work permit allows you to obtain a visa to Ukraine and a temporary residence permit.
After obtaining a work permit, a foreigner acquires the same rights as a citizen of Ukraine.

1.	How to get a work permit?

It is important to understand that in order to obtain a work permit, the employer must submit the relevant documents to the employment center, indicating in the application the period for which the permit and position must be issued.

The work of foreigners and stateless persons can be used in different positions at one or several (two or more) employers, provided that each employer obtains a permit to use the labor of foreigners and stateless persons, in case of a change of place of work or transfer to another position, another employment permit, but only in the event of a change of employer,
The work of foreigners and stateless persons may be used without a permit in part-time positions at one employer, if the term of the employment contract for the part-time position does not exceed the term of the permit at the main place of work.

2.	Validity of the employment permit.

The employment permit is issued for the employment contract term but not more than 1 year.

	 1 photo size 3.5x4.5
	 The draft employment contract is certified by the employer.

Documents are submitted through the Center for Administrative Services by the employer or a person authorized to do so by power of attorney.

All documents issued abroad must be apostille and translated into Ukrainian !!!

4.	The cost of a work permit for foreigners.

	for a period of fewer than 6 months - is 3 subsistence minimums (UAH 7 524);
	for a period of 6 months and up to one year - is 5 subsistence minimums (UAH 12, 540);
	for a period of one year to 3 years - is 10 subsistence minimums (UAH 25, 280);

The deadline for considering documents is up to 7 working days, and for the extension of a work permit, 3 working days!!!!!!

5.	Responsibility for violating the legislation of Ukraine in the field of employment of foreigners and stateless persons.

Part 5 of Article 53 of the Law of Ukraine "On Employment" provides for the imposition of fines on the employer in case of violation of the statutory procedure for employment of foreigners and stateless persons.

Thus, if the employer employs foreigners or stateless persons:

	under the terms of an employment or other contract without a permit, a fine is charged for each person in the amount of twenty times the minimum wage set at the time of detection of the violation; (130,000 hryvnias)
	under conditions other than those provided for in the permit or by another employer, a fine is levied for each person in the amount of ten times the minimum wage established at the time of detection of the violation. (65,000 hryvnias).

Also, a fine is imposed on officials of the enterprise (director) in the amount of 8,500 hryvnias to 17,000 hryvnias.

As we can see, the fines for violating employment laws are quite high, so I recommend seeking qualified legal assistance to save you time and avoid significant costs in the future.

				<div class="articles__text">
					A permanent/temporary residence permit is a document certifying the identity of a foreigner or stateless person and confirming the legal grounds for residence in Ukraine. In case of reasons for exchanging a passport, namely loss or damage of the document, the person is obliged to immediately contact the territorial division of the State Migration Service of Ukraine or the center for the provision of administrative services. And in case of abduction, you will also need to notify the authorities of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine.

What to do if the residence permit is lost (stolen)?
You need to immediately send the following package of documents to the territorial bodies of the State Migration Service and, in case of appeal, to the police authorities:
	Residence permit subject to exchange (except in cases of loss and theft);
	Passport document of a foreigner or a document certifying a stateless person;
	Translation into Ukrainian of a page of a foreigner's passport document or a document certifying a stateless person with personal data, certified in accordance with the procedure established by law;
	Documents confirming the circumstances in connection with which the permit is subject to exchange (except for cases of expiration of the permit and unfitness of the permit for further use);


The term of consideration of documents is 15 working days.
It is also important to understand that both the submission of documents and the subsequent receipt of a ready-made residence permit are done personally by the applicant himself or a legal representative, since the identity verification procedure (photo and fingerprints) takes place.

By contacting me for help in restoring or exchanging a residence permit in Ukraine, you are guaranteed to be able to get a new permit quickly. At the same time, the price will be the most favorable, and the professionalism and range of services will be the maximum.
