					<div class="articles__text">
						<p>Ukraine is a country that has always interested many foreign citizens, companies, foreign entrepreneurs, banks to introduce their activities, open businesses and invest in Ukrainian projects, which enables the Ukrainian economy to progress every year. Even during the war, Ukraine remains a platform for introducing a successful business, and after the war, I believe that Ukraine will become one of the largest countries in Europe, in which people will want to invest and open their businesses.</p>
						<p>Therefore, I would like to briefly describe the steps of how a foreigner can register himself as an individual entrepreneur, which will enable you to start introducing your business in the territory of Ukraine.</p><br>
						 
						<p class="articles__weight articles__fz">STEP 1.</p>
						<p>First of all, to register a natural person-entrepreneur, a foreigner needs to be <span class="articles__weight">legally</span> in the territory of Ukraine: you need to obtain a temporary or permanent residence permit in Ukraine and register your place of residence.</p>
						And also, the foreigner will need to get an identification tax number. <span class="articles__weight">(the service is free and the delivery period is 5 working days).</span>
						<p>An important point will be to correctly specify the types of activities according to the classifier and choose exactly those types that you will need in your activity.</p>
						<p class="articles__style">It is worth remembering that conducting activities that do not correspond to those specified in the registration data of the FOP may entail sanctions.</p>
						 
						<p class="articles__weight articles__fz">STEP 2.</p>
						<p>After you have received all the necessary documents, namely: <span class="articles__color articles__underline">an identification tax number, a temporary/permanent residence permit, a notarized translation of your passport into Ukrainian</span>, you need to contact the relevant registration service or a notary and submit an application for the registration of a natural person-entrepreneur.</p>
						 
						<p class="articles__weight articles__fz">STEP 3.</p>
						<p>The term of registration usually takes one day after submitting an application for registration of a natural person-entrepreneur.</p>
						<p>After that, you will need to receive an extract that will confirm the registration of an individual entrepreneur.</p>
						<p class="articles__weight articles__color articles__underline articles__arrow">If a person who has not reached the age of majority, but has reached the age of 16 and plans to register as an individual entrepreneur, a notarized written consent of parents or guardians is required.</div></p>

						<p class="articles__weight">1. Who is a foreign-based Ukrainian?</p>
						<span class="articles__weight">A foreign-based Ukrainian</span> is the person who is the citizen of another state or a stateless individual, and also having Ukrainian ethnic origin or having origin from Ukraine. Particularly, such a person or his/her ancestors belong to the Ukrainian nation and recognize Ukraine as the homeland of their ethnic origin. Obtaining such status is possible under certain conditions, among which are Ukrainian self-identification, the Ukrainian ethnic origin or origin from Ukraine and lack of citizenship of Ukraine. The last condition is very important, as only a foreigner or a stateless individual can receive a status of foreign-based Ukrainian.
						<p>The Ukrainian ethnic origin or origin from Ukraine of the applicant is supported by the relevant documents (archival birth certificate, residence certificate, death certificate, marriage certificate) certificate or certificates of citizens of Ukraine; foreign-based Ukrainians; or public organizations of foreign-based Ukrainians. Persons wishing to acquire the status of the foreign Ukrainian submits the written application about provision of the status of the foreign-based Ukrainian in an embassy or a consular institutions of Ukraine abroad or in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. The consideration of documents may take up to 90 days from the date of request, and after a person obtains the certificate of the foreign-based Ukrainian.

						<p>The permanent residence permit is a document confirming the right of a foreigner or stateless person to permanent residence in the country. This is usually a document that gives the right to leave and enter the country freely throughout the period of validity of the permanent residence permit.</p>
						<p>The permanent residence permit is issued on the basis of an immigration permit, so after a positive decision to obtain an immigration permit, a foreigner can apply for a permanent residence permit.</p>
	
						<p class="articles__weight">Advantages of a permanent residence permit:</p>
						<ol>
						<li>1. The right to employment without a relevant employment permit;</li>
						<li>2. Visit the country without limits on the number;</li>
						<li>3. No need to extend the validity of the certificate every year;</li>
						<li>4. A foreigner retains his / her citizenship of the country, but at the same time is a resident of Ukraine.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>It is important to understand that a foreigner is issued a copy of the immigration permit, as the original remains with the Migration Service.</p>
	
						<p>List of documents that must be submitted to the migration service to obtain a temporary residence permit:</p>
							<li>Original passport.,</li>
							<li>Notarized and translated passport of a foreigner.,,</li>

						<p class="articles__weight articles__color articles__underline articles__arrow">If a foreigner was not on the territory of Ukraine during the examination of immigration permit documents, he will need to obtain a separate type D visa.</p>
	
						<p>The deadline for consideration of documents is 15 working days.</p>
	
						<p class="articles__style">After you have received a temporary residence permit, you need to register your place of residence in Ukraine within 30 days from the date of issue of the Permanent residence permit you received. Sometimes foreigners think that 30 days are deducted from the moment of obtaining a permanent residence permit, but this is not the case, 30 days are deducted from the date of issue, which is indicated on the permanent residence permit itself.</p>
	
						<p>In general, the procedure for obtaining a temporary residence permit does not seem complicated at first glance, but in practice, the situation is completely different, there are many unclear details and the process requires close contact with the State Migration Service.</p>

						<p>Work permit for foreigners and stateless persons - a document that entitles the employer to temporarily use the work of a foreigner or stateless person, or voluntarily obtained by a resident of Action City to enter into a big contract with a foreigner or stateless person.</p>
						<p>According to the legislation of Ukraine, foreigners and stateless persons cannot work without a work permit. In addition, a work permit allows you to obtain a visa to Ukraine and a temporary residence permit.</p>
						<p>After obtaining a work permit, a foreigner acquires the same rights as a citizen of Ukraine.</p>
	
						<p>1.	How to get a work permit?
	
						<p class="articles__weight">It is important to understand that in order to obtain a work permit, the employer must submit the relevant documents to the employment center, indicating in the application the period for which the permit and position must be issued.</p>
	
						<p class="articles__weight">The work of foreigners and stateless persons can be used in different positions at one or several (two or more) employers, provided that each employer obtains a permit to use the labor of foreigners and stateless persons, in case of a change of place of work or transfer to another position, another employment permit, but only in the event of a change of employer.<br>
							The work of foreigners and stateless persons may be used without a permit in part-time positions at one employer, if the term of the employment contract for the part-time position does not exceed the term of the permit at the main place of work.</p>
						</p>
						<p>2.	Validity of the employment permit.
	
						<p>The employment permit is issued for the employment contract term but not more than 1 year.</p>
	
						<p class="articles__weight">Exception: for foreign highly paid professionals, founders and/or participants, and/or beneficiaries (controllers) of a legal entity established in Ukraine; graduates of universities included in the top 100 in the world rankings of universities, according to the list determined by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine; foreign workers of creative professions; foreign IT professionals work permit can be issued for up to 3 years.</p>
						</p>
						<p>3.	List of required documents:

							<li>Notarized and translated copy of the foreigner's passport</li>
							<li>1 photo size 3.5x4.5</li>

						</p>
						<p>4.	The cost of a work permit for foreigners.

						</p>
						<p>5.	Responsibility for violating the legislation of Ukraine in the field of employment of foreigners and stateless persons.</p>
	
						<p>Part 5 of Article 53 of the Law of Ukraine "On Employment" provides for the imposition of fines on the employer in case of violation of the statutory procedure for employment of foreigners and stateless persons.</p>
	
						<p>Thus, if the employer employs foreigners or stateless persons:</p>
	
						<li>under the terms of an employment or other contract without a permit, a fine is charged for each person in the amount of twenty times the minimum wage set at the time of detection of the violation; (130,000 hryvnias)</li>
						<li>under conditions other than those provided for in the permit or by another employer, a fine is levied for each person in the amount of ten times the minimum wage established at the time of detection of the violation. (65,000 hryvnias).</li>
	
						<p>Also, a fine is imposed on officials of the enterprise (director) in the amount of 8,500 hryvnias to 17,000 hryvnias.</p>
	
						<p class="articles__weight">As we can see, the fines for violating employment laws are quite high, so I recommend seeking qualified legal assistance to save you time and avoid significant costs in the future.</p>
